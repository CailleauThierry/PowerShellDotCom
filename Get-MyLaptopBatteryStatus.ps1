	.DESCRIPTION
		hecking Battery Wear and Quality
All Versions
If you run a laptop you can easily ask WMI for battery status such as charging status. With a little bit more work, though, you can also check the wear of your battery and find out whether itâ€™s time to replace the battery.
Essentially, the script below uses different WMI classes to determine your battery nominal capacity and its real capacity, then calculating its effective capacity in percent. Any percentage below 80% typically indicates a high degree of wear and need for battery replacement.

ForEach-Object {
    $_.DesignedCapacity = $designCap[$_. InstanceName].DesignedCapacity
    $_.Percent = [Math]::Round( ( $_.FullChargedCapacity*100/$_.DesignedCapacity), 2)
