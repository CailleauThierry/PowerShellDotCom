<# Obviously, when the System event log was cleared, the results are no longer complete. Also, the log simply logs any update installation, so over time new updates can replace older updates.
To guarantee you get a complete list of currently installed updates, youâ€™d have to ask the Windows Update Client to re-construct the list from the actual installed updates which takes a lot longer:#>

$result | Out-GridView -Title 'Installed Updates'
